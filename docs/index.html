<h1 align="middle">CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging, Spring 2017</h1>
<h1 align="middle">Final Project Proposal</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Karthik Shanmugam and David Niu</h2>
<h3 align="middle"> Insert 2-3 sentences of awesomeness </h3>
<br><br>

<div>

<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<p>Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.</p>
<p>We want to solve the problem of planet generation. Given the texture for a planet, we want to procedurally generate a realistic looking planned, with terrain deformations at large and small scales. This is important because it allows for realistic looking worlds at multiple scales, which is especially useful in games such as open world games. One challenge is procedurally generating realistic looking terrain. We need to generate terrain that matches with the provided planet texture. For example the oceans should remain flat and maybe contain waves, whereas the land should have more significant bumps and craters. Another challenge is rendering the generated terrain at multiple scales. Ideally a planet should contain detail even when we zoom in. For example we want an earth size planet to contain not only mountain size bumps, but also plenty of distortions closer to the size of a person. However, generating an entire planet mesh with all these distortions would lead to an infeasibly large planet mesh. We intend to solve this issue by dynamically generating a mesh given our camera location and resolution, only computing the details for parts of the planet that will be visible to the camera.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p>
This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).</p>

<p>We want to render multiple images of a planet. The images should clearly show realistic deformations on the sphere representing the planet, as well as possibly different materials for different types of terrain (water, grass, sand, etc.). We also want to render multiple images centered at the same part of the planet at different zoom levels, showing deformations at small and large scales. We hope to be able to procedurally generate the planet textures as well</p>

<h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
<p>In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week</p>

<p>week 1: set up environment to render a sphere with texture, maybe add materials for water and not water</p>

<p>week 2: get bumps and craters and other terrain at the largest scale working</p>
<p>week 3: implement a system to generate our planet mesh right before rendering given camera info.</p>
<p>week 4: get shit working lol</p>

<h2 align="middle">Resources</h2>
<p>List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here.</p>
